# Simple Resource Aware Task Scheduling System for Heterogeneous Mobile Devices

** work in progress **

A simple DAG scheduler that uses Criticality Aware Task Scheduling algorithm (CATS) to offload computational-heavy tasks to nearby mobile devices.

## Disclaimer
Do not use this system. This is a research project focusing on the performance of task offloading on mobile device. Security is not in the scope of this project. Potential risks of using this project includes leaking sensitive data of the offloaded task to untrusted device and offloadee being sent malicious executable code. Please refrain from using this project for safety.
